## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar

Expected Behaviour:

- Boards
  - Clicking different boards in the sidebar will change to the selected board
- Tasks

  - Updating a task's status will move the task to the relevant column.
